about: My professional career began with developing solutions for DWH ecosystems.
       So naturally I gained experience with MPP, high volume OLAP cubes and various ETL processing tools.
       After a while, I got aboard with rising new approach towards data - Big Data.
       The projects that I started with were using Hadoop and MapReduce jobs, which today are already considered old-school.
       Currently I work mostly with Apache Flink, Apache Spark and Apache Kafka.
       My programming language of choice is (weirdly) Go, but I feel comfortable with Scala as well.
       As a side note, I am fluent in English which made my participation in international projects quite easy and enjoyable for my customers.
